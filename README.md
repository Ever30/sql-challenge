# sql-challenge

In this challenge, we test some of the functions that we learned during this SQL week.

# Instructions

# Data Modeling

Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBD.
Data Engineering

1.- Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:
Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

2.- Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

# Data Analysis

1.- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2.- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3.- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4.- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5.- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6.- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7.- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8.- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

# Resources

To perform this task I used the activities that we did during the past week as a reference. I also got help from my classmates in the study groups and websites like https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key.
